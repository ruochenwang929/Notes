## Git Notes
### 1. Install Git
Too lazy to teach you
### 2. Initial git
Enter a directory, then input: `git init`
### 3. Add and Commit
`git add filename`  
`git commit -m "your comment"`
### 4. Status and Difference
If you want to know which file has been modified, use `git status`  
If you want to know the changes, use `git diff`
